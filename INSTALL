=============================

Prerequisites
-------------

 * Python 2.7 or later (http://www.python.org/)
 * trytond (http://www.tryton.org/)
 * trytond_account (http://www.tryton.org/)

 * Pyafipws and swig:
     * swig
        apt-get install swig
     * PyAfipWS
        git clone --single-branch -b master https://github.com/reingart/pyafipws.git

        git clone --single-branch -b stable https://github.com/pysimplesoap/pysimplesoap.git
        ( cd pysimplesoap && python setup.py install )

Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked the account_invoice_ar source release,
enter the directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

    python setup.py install

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
this command will by default attempt to install module to the Python
site-packages directory on your system.

For advanced options, please refer to the easy_install and/or the distutils
documentation:

  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
  http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html

To use without installation, extract the archive into ``trytond/modules`` with
the directory name account_invoice_ar.
